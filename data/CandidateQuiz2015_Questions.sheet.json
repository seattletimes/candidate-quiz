    "summary": "After a quarter-century on the national stage, Clinton, 67, is certainly the presidential candidate Americans know the most about. She had a deep résumé eight years ago when she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama, and it got deeper as she traveled 1 million miles to a record 112 countries as Obama’s secretary of state. With no need to introduce herself, she is already framing her campaign not on herself (her opponents are sure to do that) but on voters' issues. Remember “It’s the economy, stupid” from Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign? Here’s the reprise for 2016: “Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,” she said in declaring her candidacy. “Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion, so you can do more than just get by — you can get ahead and stay ahead.”",

    "summary": "John Ellis “Jeb” Bush, 62, is the second son of former President George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush. Bush grew up in Houston and earned a degree in Latin American affairs from the University of Texas before working in Florida in the 1980s as a real estate developer, then as a staffer on his dad’s 1988 presidential campaign. He lost a gubernatorial bid in 1994, then won in 1998 as a “consensus-building pragmatist” and in 2002 became Florida’s first two-term GOP governor. His time in office was notable for tax cuts, Everglades protections -- and for its focus on education and school choice (he is famed for his love of books). Expect his approach in the primaries to be more positive and mainstream than some of the noisier candidates, who have drawn a lot of attention in early coverage and polls. Bush, who speaks fluent Spanish and who met his wife as a 17-year-old while on a foreign exchange in Mexico, has decried his rivals’ “crazy message of hate” and said he takes personally Donald Trump’s incendiary comments about Mexican immigrants.",

He has been a tireless crusader throughout his political career on social issues shaped by his Catholic faith, opposing same-sex marriage and abortion rights and promoting conservative values. His views on homosexuality made him a target for Seattle sex columnist and LGBT activist Dan Savage, who started a campaign in 2003 that managed to hijack Santorum’s name into an obscene euphemism in urban dictionaries and search engines. In his 2012 primary campaign, Santorum gained widespread support from social conservatives, but he ultimately suspended his campaign when his youngest daughter, Bella, who was born with a rare genetic disorder, became seriously ill. Santorum mentioned cultural issues briefly in announcing his candidacy this time: “As president, I will stand for the principle that every life matters — the poor, the disabled and the unborn.” But in an interview with NBC News, he blamed his 2012 loss on talking about “dumb things” and said a 2016 run would be predicated on the economy more than social issues. That may be pragmatic: Many candidates in the big Republican field are gunning for Santorum’s religious conservative base.",

His skill took him across the globe on high-profile cases including 1987’s first-ever successful separation of twins conjoined at the back of the head. He was raised in abject poverty in inner-city Detroit by a mother who dropped out of school in third grade and married at 13. Yet she made her sons read two books per week and challenged them to excel. This bootstrap success story has made Carson an inspiration to the citizens of Detroit and to tea party conservatives alike. A devout Seventh Day Adventist, he also appeals to the religious right. Carson has received 67 honorary doctorate degrees. In 2001, the Library of Congress named him one of its “Living Legends,” and in 2008, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. One accolade is closer to home: Detroit’s Benjamin Carson High School of Science and Medicine. Carson is the author of bestselling books, including his autobiography, “Gifted Hands,” and Cuba Gooding Jr. played him in the movie. In 2013, he thrilled conservatives by delivering a 27-minute speech at the National Prayer Breakfast excoriating President Obama’s policies – while Obama shared the stage. Carson has made rhetorical missteps along the way for which he has had to apologize even to supporters, such as calling Obamacare “the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.” Said Carson in announcing his bid: “I’m not a politician. I don’t want to be a politician, because politicians do what is politically expedient. I want to do what’s right.”",

After mustering out due to combat injuries – shrapnel in his kidney, knee and head -- he attended Georgetown law and worked as a House staffer on veterans affairs. He was an assistant defense secretary and then secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan, the first Annapolis grad to oversee the Navy. After resigning in 1988, he worked as an author of novels and nonfiction and as a filmmaker, winning an Emmy for a PBS documentary on U.S. Marines killed in Beirut. He even wrote the Hollywood screenplay for “Rules of Engagement,” starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. In 2002, he wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post opposing the run-up to the Iraq war, and he later charged President George W. Bush with committing “the greatest strategic blunder in modern memory.” There was little love lost between him and Bush – at a 2006 White House reception, the two had a testy exchange regarding Webb’s son Jimmy, who was serving in Iraq at the time. It was so tense, Webb later had to set up a private White House meeting with Bush and Jimmy to bury the hatchet. In his Senate tenure, he was best known for sponsoring a post-9/11 GI Bill.
